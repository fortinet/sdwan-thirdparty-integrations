## Introduction: 

Fortinet, a leading cybersecurity company, offers a range of products and solutions that can be integrated with vendors, partners, and customers to enhance their cybersecurity capabilities. In this project we are providing SDWAN solution integration with few of the vendors, but Fortinet’s integration capabilities exceed far beyond just SD-WAN. Here are some common integration scenarios:

## Vendor Integration: 

Fortinet products can integrate with other technology vendors to provide comprehensive security solutions. For example, Fortinet's Security Fabric architecture allows integration with third-party products such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, endpoint security solutions, and identity and access management (IAM) platforms. This integration enables seamless sharing of security intelligence and enhances threat detection and response capabilities. In the project, we have shown SD-WAN solution integration with NetSkope, Skyhigh and Zscaler. 

## Partner Integration: 

Fortinet works closely with technology partners to create joint solutions and integrations that address specific customer needs. These partnerships often involve combining Fortinet's security products with complementary technologies from partners, such as cloud service providers, network infrastructure vendors, or managed security service providers (MSSPs). These integrations help customers deploy comprehensive and integrated security solutions.

## Customer Integration: 

Fortinet products are designed to integrate within customer environments to provide end-to-end security. This can include integration with network infrastructure, such as switches and routers, to enforce security policies and ensure consistent protection across the network. Fortinet's security products can also integrate with customer-owned or third-party security tools to centralize and correlate security events and streamline incident response.

## Automation:

Fortinet provides a range of APIs, software development kits (SDKs), and integration documentation to facilitate these integrations. They offer standardized protocols like RESTful APIs, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), and Syslog for seamless interoperability with other systems. Additionally, Fortinet's FortiPartner program supports collaboration with partners to deliver integrated solutions to customers.

And Finally, it's worth noting that the specific integrations available may vary, depending on the Fortinet products being used and the requirements of the vendors, partners, and customers involved. For detailed information and guidance on integration possibilities, it is recommended to consult Fortinet's official documentation, support resources, or engage with sales and technical teams.
